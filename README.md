### RISK FACTOR ANALYSIS FOR HEART DISEASE USING AGE AND ALCOHOL VARIABLES

According to CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death and about half of Americans have at least one risk factor. This dataset of 400k people was analysed to determine the risk factors of heart disease and its impact. People of all ages ranging from 18 to 80 years or above participated and were asked questions.

- It was observed from this dataset that about 8.6% people have heart disease such as Coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI) and the majority of them were aged 50 or above. Heart disease and age has positive correlation. As the age increases, the risk of heart disease increases.

- Next risk factor in the study was alcohol drinking. Men were asked if they consume more than 14 drinks per week and females were asked if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. According to CDC (2022), moderate alcohol consumption is 2 drinks or less for males and 1 drink or less for females. 21,777 people answered yes for this question which makes it about 6.8% people. Out of which 1141 had heart disease. So according to this data, moderate alcohol consumption does not affect very greatly on risk of getting heart disease unless there are exception such as high BP or pregnant women.

- In an analysis of heart disease in relation to BMI, there is a demonstrated correlation between the two. it is clearly seen that the further away one gets from a healthy BMI (defined as 18.5-24.9 by the CDC), the more likely one is to have heart disease. Those who are underweight (less than 18.5 BMI) have an increased risk of heart disease, but less so than those whose BMI is greater than the healthy range. The number of people with heart disease steadily increases as BMI increases, and conversely, the number of people without heart disease increases as the number approaches the healthy BMI range.

- In the analysis of the sexes, the occurrence of heart disease between Males and Females was studied. Is there a difference in the risk of heart disease between males and females and which sex in more likely to get a heart disease?. This study included a sample of over 167k females and 151k males. We found that approximately 6.7% of the female participants and 10.6 % of the male participants have been diagnosed with a heart disease. This was visualized using a bar chart. Interestingly, even though there were more female participants in the study, a higher percentage of males were diagnosed with a heart disease. Based on this data, we can conclude that males appear to have a higher risk of developing heart disease compared to females.

- Smoking was also analyzed as a risk factor. Does smoking increase the likelihood of developing a heart disease? To investigate this, the participants were asked if they have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime- The results showed that 41.2% responded 'yes,' while 58.5% responded 'no'. Two pie charts were created to visualize the difference in heart disease occurrence between participants that smoke, and those that do not. The results showed that among smokers,  12.2%  have been diagnosed with heart disease and 6% of non- smokers have been diagnosed with heart disease.From these findings, we can draw a clear conclusion that smoking increases one's likelihood of developing heart disease.

In this dataset most relevant variables/ factors were chosen. Data was cleaned by dropping rows that had missing data. Process was carried out to make sure dataset is relevant and useful to find out answer to the question- Can you indicate which factors have a significant effect on the likelihood of heart disease?
