### RISK FACTOR ANALYSIS FOR HEART DISEASE USING AGE AND ALCOHOL VARIABLES

According to CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death and about half of americans have atleast one risk factors. This dataset of 400k people was analysed to determine the risk factors of heart disease and its impact. People of all ages ranging from 18 to 80 years or above took part and asked questions.

- It was observed from this dataset that about 8.6% people have heart disease such as Coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI) and majority of them were 50 or above. Heart disease and age has positive correlation. As the age increases, the risk of heart disease increases.

- Next risk factor in the study was alcohol drinking. Men were asked if they consume more than 14 drinks per week and females were asked if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. According to CDC (2022), moderate alcohol consumption is 2 drinks or less for males and 1 drink or less for females. 21,777 people answered yes for this question which makes it about 6.8% people. Out of which 1141 had heart disease. So according to this data, moderate alcohol consumption does not affect very greatly on risk of getting heart disease unless there are exception such as high BP or pregnant women.

In this dataset most relevant varaibles/ factors were chosen. Data was cleaned by dropping rows that had missing data. Process was carried out to make sure dataset is relevant and useful to find out answer to the question- Can you indicate which factors have a significant effect on the likelihood of heart disease?
